Scriv2Fic is a Chrome/Firefox browser extension that enables direct compilation and uploading of Scrivener projects to Fimfiction. 
It can upload individual chapters, groups of chapters, or entire projects at a time. It also automatically converts your documents into 
Fimfiction-compliant BBCode. It is accessed through the "Import Chapter" menu on Fimfiction's story pages.

BBCode conversions currently supported:
* All standard character stylings (bold, italics, underline, color, small caps, sub/superscript, strikethrough)
* Text alignment (left/right/center)
* Lists
* Links (URL and email)
* Horizontal rules

BBCode conversions not currently supported:
* Formatting not currently supported by Fimfiction (tables, footnotes, etc.)
* Equations
* Variable font sizes (Degrade cleanly)
* Headers (Degrade cleanly)
* Quotes
* Images
* Manual indentation (Degrades cleanly)

Note that all supported formatting can still be achieved manually through normal means.
